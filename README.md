# Space Engineers Project (sep)

This project is in a very early stage. Right now is something like a POC (proof of concept).

My objective is to make a tool that can automate some calculation processes, like the mass of objects. I got into this after doing some research about the game. I found out that the data provided is not accurate, or at least has it not been updated in a while, so I want to make a tool to automate the parsing and computing and hopefully export it to something like a spreedsheet so that it can be shared. Having a program to automate all this process is necessary in order to keep the data up to date.
